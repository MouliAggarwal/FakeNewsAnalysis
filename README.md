# FakeNewsAnalysis

# Project Description
This project aims to analyze and detect fake news using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to identify patterns, linguistic features, and sentiment differences within news articles to help improve awareness and automated detection of misinformation.

# Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle

Content: The dataset consists of news articles labeled as 'fake' or 'real.' It includes fields such as title, author, content, and publication date.

Key Features: Title, Text, Date, Source, Author, Category, Label, Tone

# Tone Used
Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data compilation, cleaning (removal of duplicates, missing values), and for creating preliminary visualizations such as charts and graphs.

Google Colab: Served as the primary platform for Python analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.

Python Libraries:
pandas: Used for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK/TextBlob: Employed for Natural Language Processing, sentiment, and tone analysis on the news articles.

# Analysis Workflow
1. Data Preparation
Imported the dataset into Microsoft Excel for initial inspection.
Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values to ensure accuracy for further analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics (e.g., counts by label, basic descriptive stats) in Excel.
Created visual summaries, such as bar and pie charts, to explore trends in the dataset.

5. Data Import Into Python
Loaded the cleaned dataset into Google Colab for in-depth analysis using Python.

6. Sentiment and Tone Analysis
Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques via NLTK/TextBlob to assess the polarity and subjectivity of news articles.
Compared linguistic patterns between fake and real news articles.

5. Visualization and Interpretation
Leveraged Python libraries to produce visualizations illustrating patterns, distributions, and key differentiators between authentic and fake news.
